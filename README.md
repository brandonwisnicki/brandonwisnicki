#### 🌌 Hello there 

🖥️ I'm currently a Second-Year studying Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm interested in computer graphics, blockchain, & security. 

🧭 I'm currently the CTO of [Ontern](https://www.ontern.com), where I have the pleasure of leading the company's technical vision and development of our SaaS platform. 

☀️ If I'm not programming, you'll find me playing with my dog Buffy🐶, jamming to Billy Joel, or getting incredibly sunburnt on a Florida beach. Preferably all 3 at once.

📠 You can reach me at me@brandonwisnicki.com or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bwiz/).

🌐 Here are a few of the sites that I have built:
- [Ontern](https://www.ontern.com) - React & Node.js
- [Diodorus History](https://diodorushistory.com/) - Angular & Firebase
- [EduCare](https://educarehealth.org/) & [EduCare Booster Eligiblity Quiz](https://educarehealth.org/resources/vaccine-quiz) - React
