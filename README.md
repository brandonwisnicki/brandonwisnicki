#### 🌌 Hello there 

🖥️ I've recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Master's and Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I'm interested in computer graphics, data analytics, & security. 

🚀 I was previously at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com) as a software engineering intern. I will be returning in the Fall.

☀️ If I'm not programming, you'll find me playing with my dog Buffy🐶, jamming to Billy Joel, or getting incredibly sunburnt on a Florida beach. Preferably all 3 at once.

📠 You can reach me at me@brandonwisnicki.com or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bwiz/).
